# Anchor Proximity Checker

## Purpose
Show distance to an anchor without implying an outcome prediction.

## Inputs
- System parameters required to compute distance to the anchor.

## Outputs
- Quantified distance to the anchor.
- Explicit warning if the input is beyond the threshold.

## Rejection Rule
If inputs violate the anchor, return a rejection with the violated threshold.
