# Admissibility vs Prediction

Admissibility determines whether a claim is possible given an anchor. Prediction estimates what might happen within the admissible space.

## Anchor
Admissibility is bounded by an immutable constraint.

## Threshold
The threshold separates permissible claims from impossible claims.

## Consequence of Crossing
Crossing the threshold invalidates the prediction category rather than just changing a probability.

## Why Optimization Cannot Override It
Optimizers can refine predictions but cannot legitimize inadmissible claims.
