# Failure as Category Collapse

Failure is not a continuous degradation past an anchor; it is a categorical collapse where the claimed class of behavior no longer exists.

## Anchor
The boundary that defines the category of admissible behavior.

## Threshold
The point where the system exits the category entirely.

## Consequence of Crossing
Past the threshold, the system is not a degraded version of itself; it is a different class with different constraints.

## Why Optimization Cannot Override It
Optimization can delay boundary contact but cannot preserve the category once the boundary is crossed.
