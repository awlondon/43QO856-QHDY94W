# What Is a Reality Anchor

A Reality Anchor is an immutable constraint that bounds what a system can be, regardless of models, narratives, or optimization goals. It is expressed as a hard boundary with a threshold and a consequence when crossed.

## Anchor
An immutable constraint that is independent of intent, belief, or measurement approach.

## Threshold
A precise condition that separates admissible states from inadmissible states.

## Consequence of Crossing
Crossing the threshold collapses a category of outcomes: the system can no longer behave as claimed.

## Why Optimization Cannot Override It
Optimization can shift behavior within the admissible region but cannot expand the boundary without violating the constraint itself.
