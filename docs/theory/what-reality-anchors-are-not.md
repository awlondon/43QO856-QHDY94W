# What Reality Anchors Are Not

Reality Anchors are not motivational frameworks, predictive models, or narrative devices. They are not softened constraints and cannot be replaced by probabilistic goals.

## Anchor
Constraints that are invariant to framing or optimization.

## Threshold
The boundary condition is explicit and testable.

## Consequence of Crossing
Claims that rely on states beyond the threshold are inadmissible.

## Why Optimization Cannot Override It
Optimization does not change the constraint; it only searches within what is already allowed.
