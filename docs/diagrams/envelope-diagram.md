# Envelope Diagram

## Purpose
Show the operational envelope where a system remains admissible.

## Anchor
Envelope edges defined by immutable constraints.

## Threshold
Specific limits on variables that define the envelope.

## Consequence of Crossing
Exiting the envelope invalidates the claimed operating mode.
