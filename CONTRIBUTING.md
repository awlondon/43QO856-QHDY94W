## Anchor Requirements
New anchors must include:
- Domain justification
- Threshold definition
- Failure discontinuity

Submissions that add interpretation without a constraint are rejected.

## Tone
Write like an engineer. If uncertain, state it explicitly.

## Language Inflation
Overstating claims or softening anchors is grounds for closure.
