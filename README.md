# CODEx: Reality Anchors

CODEx is a theory + practice hub for Reality Anchors: immutable constraints that define what a system can be, independent of models or optimization goals. The repository is organized to document anchors, show how they fail, and provide tools that refuse inadmissible inputs. For the canonical instructions, see `CODEX.md`.

## How to Use This Repository
- Start with `docs/theory/what-is-a-reality-anchor.md` for the core definition.
- Browse `docs/anchors/` to see domain-specific anchors and their thresholds.
- Review `docs/diagrams/` and `docs/simulations/` to understand boundary behavior.
- Use `docs/tools/` for anchor-aware checks that surface inadmissible claims.

## Structure
See `CODEX.md` for the full structure and contribution rules.
