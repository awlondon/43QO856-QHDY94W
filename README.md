# Reality Anchors

**Reality Anchors** are immutable constraints that define what a system *can be*, not merely what it *can do*.  
They exist independently of models, narratives, or optimization goals.

When a Reality Anchor is crossed, the system does not degrade gracefully —  
it **ceases to be the thing it was claimed to be**.

This repository documents the theory, practice, and applications of Reality Anchors across physical, biological, computational, financial, and social systems.

## What This Project Is

Reality Anchors provide a **disciplinary framework** for reasoning about limits, admissibility, and failure in complex systems.

They are used to:
- Identify **non‑negotiable boundaries** (physical, biological, logical, legal)
- Prevent **category errors** (treating models as reality)
- Clarify **where prediction stops and consequences begin**
- Explain why systems often fail *suddenly*, not gradually

This project is **not** about forecasting outcomes.  
It is about identifying **where claims stop being valid**.

## What This Project Is Not

- Not a motivational or philosophical metaphor
- Not a predictive AI framework
- Not a replacement for domain‑specific methods
- Not a theory of optimization or control

Reality Anchors do not tell you *what will happen*.  
They tell you **what cannot be argued past**.

## Core Ideas

- **Reality Anchors**  
  Hard constraints that define admissibility (e.g. friction limits, metabolic requirements, solvency).

- **Admissibility**  
  Whether a claim, model, or capability remains meaningful within those constraints.

- **Failure as Category Collapse**  
  Many failures are not malfunctions — they are **identity failures** caused by crossing an anchor.

- **Pre‑Failure Blindness**  
  Systems often appear stable precisely because anchors are poorly observed or misunderstood.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Core Theory**  
  Clear definitions and boundaries for Reality Anchors and admissibility.

- **Anchor Library**  
  Canonical anchors across domains, each with thresholds and consequences.

- **Diagrams & Visuals**  
  Boundary‑first visuals showing discontinuities and collapse points.

- **Interactive Tools**  
  Simple utilities for checking anchor proximity and admissibility.

- **Simulations**  
  Demonstrations of where models stop working (not outcome prediction).

- **Case Studies**  
  Real failures explained through misplaced or ignored anchors.

- **Cross‑Domain Mapping**  
  How the same structural idea appears under different names (ODD, safety envelope, invariants).

## Who This Is For

- Engineers working in safety‑critical or complex systems
- AI researchers and evaluators
- Scientists and systems thinkers
- Policy, infrastructure, and risk professionals
- Anyone tired of arguments that ignore physical or logical limits

## Guiding Principle

> **Reality Anchors are where arguments stop and consequences begin.**

---

## Status

This project is under active development.  
Clarity and rigor take priority over speed or breadth.

Contributions are welcome — **but only if they respect immutability, thresholds, and admissibility**.
