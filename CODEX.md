# CODEx: Reality Anchors
Canonical Instructions for a GitHub-Hosted Theory + Practice Hub

## 0. Purpose & Scope (Non-Negotiable)
**Purpose:**
Document, operationalize, and stress-test the concept of Reality Anchors as immutable constraints that define what a system can be, independent of models, narratives, or optimization goals.

**Non-Goals:**
- Not a motivational framework
- Not predictive magic
- Not a replacement for domain methods
- Not metaphor-first writing

Everything published must pass the test:
- Does this identify a hard boundary, or explain what happens when one is crossed?

## 2. Core Theory Section (/docs/theory)
**Required Pages**
- What Is a Reality Anchor
- What Reality Anchors Are Not
- Admissibility vs Prediction
- Anchors vs Models vs Metrics
- Failure as Category Collapse

**Content Rules**
Every claim must include:
- The anchor
- The threshold
- The consequence of crossing

No metaphors without a literal grounding paragraph.

Explicitly state why optimization cannot override the anchor.

## 3. Anchor Library (/docs/anchors)
Anchors are the spine of the site.

**Anchor Entry Template (Mandatory)**
- Anchor Name
- Domain
- Immutable Constraint
- Threshold Definition
- What Breaks When Crossed
- Common Misinterpretations
- Related Anchors

**Required Domains**
- Physics
- Engineering
- Biology
- Autonomous Systems
- Finance
- Information Systems
- Governance / Law
- Psychology (grounded, not therapeutic)

Each anchor must be domain-specific but cross-linkable.

## 4. Diagrams & Visual Language (/docs/diagrams)
**Diagram Types (Standardized)**
- Boundary Diagrams (inside vs outside admissibility)
- Envelope Diagrams (operational space)
- Collapse Diagrams (what disappears past the anchor)
- False-Continuity Diagrams (why rollback fails)

**Style Rules**
- Prefer edges, boundaries, and cut-offs over gradients.
- No “smooth” visuals where reality is discontinuous.
- SVG first, raster second.

## 5. Interactive Tools (/docs/tools)
**Required Tools (Phase 1)**
- Anchor Proximity Checker
  - Input parameters -> shows distance to anchor, not outcome.
- Admissibility Filter
  - Given a claim/model -> flags category violations.
- Anchor Comparator
  - Same system under different anchors -> what changes?

**Design Rule**
Tools must refuse inputs that violate anchors.
Silence is not allowed—rejection must be explicit.

## 6. Simulations (/docs/simulations)
Simulations exist to show where models stop working, not to predict outcomes.

**Required Simulation Types**
- Crossing-the-Boundary (sudden collapse)
- Near-Anchor Stability (false confidence)
- Irreversibility Demos (hysteresis)

**Rule**
Every simulation must include a “Why This Is Not Predictive” panel.

## 7. Case Studies (/docs/case-studies)
**Required Structure**
- System Description
- Claimed Capability
- Ignored or Misplaced Anchor
- Crossing Event
- Post-Crossing Reality
- What Models Got Wrong

Include:
- Engineering failures
- AI system overclaims
- Financial collapses
- Biological misclassifications
- Regulatory blind spots

## 8. Cross-Domain Mapping (/docs/cross-domain)
Show the same structural anchor under different names:
- “Operating Envelope”
- “ODD”
- “Hard Constraint”
- “Point of No Return”
- “Reality Testing”

Goal: unify without flattening.

## 9. History & Lineage (/docs/history)
Track:
- Early physics invariants
- Safety engineering envelopes
- Biological definitions of life
- Cognitive grounding / reality testing
- Modern AI & autonomy failures

**Rule:**
History is about rediscovery of anchors, not progress narratives.

## 10. Modern Usage (/docs/cross-domain/modern)
Explicit sections for:
- Autonomous vehicles
- AI safety & evals
- Infrastructure & grids
- Medicine & physiology
- Governance & regulation

Each must answer:
- What claim becomes inadmissible past this anchor?

## 11. Future Prospects (/docs/future)
**Allowed topics:**
- Better anchor observability
- Anchor-aware AI monitoring
- Pre-failure diagnostics (non-predictive)
- Education & literacy

**Disallowed:**
- “Solving complexity”
- “Replacing experts”
- “Eliminating failure”

## 12. Cross-Linking Rules
Every anchor page must link to:
- ≥1 diagram
- ≥1 case study
- ≥1 tool or simulation

No orphan pages.

GLOSSARY terms must link bidirectionally.

## 13. Contribution Rules (/CONTRIBUTING.md)
New anchors require:
- Domain justification
- Threshold definition
- Failure discontinuity

PRs that add interpretation without constraint are rejected.

Language inflation is grounds for closure.

## 14. Tone & Epistemic Discipline
Write like an engineer, not a prophet.

If something is uncertain, mark it explicitly.

If something is continuous, don’t pretend it’s an anchor.

If something is an anchor, don’t soften it.

## 15. One-Line North Star (Pinned)
Reality Anchors are where arguments stop and consequences begin.
